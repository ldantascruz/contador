# People Counter

A new Flutter project to perform people counting in a given location.

## Getting Started

Recently I was thinking about the scenario we live in, a pandemic! <br>
So I decided to develop this application in Flutter. <br>
It mainly serves to limit the entry of people into establishments. <br>
He is literally a people counter. <br>
Its functions are basically to increment and decrement people of an accountant. <br>
I also implemented the function to reset the count.
